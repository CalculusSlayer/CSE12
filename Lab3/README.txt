INSTRUCTIONS

This program requires a MIPS Simulator (MARS) to run. Enter an integer greater than 0 for a triangle with x many rows.
'x' is the input of the user. An integer less than or equal to zero will prompt the user to type in another integer.
An input other than an integer will terminate the program. Also, make sure that delayed branching is turned off while
running the program.
